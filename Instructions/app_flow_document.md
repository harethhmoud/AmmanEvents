# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is designed as a centralized platform for event discovery in Jordan. It lets users find events based on their location, interests, and timing while providing event organizers with tools to create, manage, and market their events. Whether you are an event organizer, an attendee, or a business looking to promote local activities, the goal is to offer a user-friendly, mobile-first experience. The core functionalities include event creation and management, ticketing with multiple digital payment options, real-time notifications, and analytics for organizers, all within a bilingual interface supporting Arabic and English.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

A new user visiting the platform is greeted by an inviting landing page that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. Users are presented with clear options to sign up using OAuth, their email, or phone number, ensuring that the registration process is fast and secure. Upon registration, users can choose their preferred language, either Arabic or English, which then sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The sign-up process is streamlined, and includes measures for recovering lost passwords and managing account security. Existing users can easily sign in from the same landing page, and once signed in, they have an obvious option to sign out in the top navigation or account settings.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once signed in, users are taken to their personalized dashboard, which acts as the home page of the app. The default view presents event recommendations, upcoming event listings, and a summary of recent user activity. This page is designed with a mobile-first approach and features a clean, intuitive layout with a navigation menu at the top or side, allowing users to seamlessly transition between different sections. Whether a user wants to browse for events, check saved events through their wishlist, or explore personalized event categories based on geolocation, all major elements are integrated within this central dashboard.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The platform flows naturally from one key component to another. Attendees start with event discovery by using search fields and filters that incorporate keywords, event categories, and location-based criteria. The geolocation filter not only allows proximity-based sorting, but also includes an interactive map view that visually plots events in the area. When an attendee selects an event, they are taken to a detailed event page. This page provides all relevant event information including schedule, venue details, ticket pricing options, and descriptions. Users are offered the ability to add the event to their wishlist and set reminders via push notifications or email.

For purchasing tickets, the system guides users through a secure ticketing process. Users are provided with multiple payment options that cater to the local market through card payments using an API, as well as alternative methods such as paying in cash at the event or using Cliq. The ticketing flow emphasizes ease of use and security by complying with PCI-DSS standards. Additionally, organizers are provided a separate dashboard where they can create new events, edit existing events, and manage their ticket sales and event analytics. This organizer view includes comprehensive tools for uploading event information, managing schedules, and accessing performance metrics like ticket sales, engagement rates, and demographic insights.

Organizers and administrators have access to advanced pages where they can manage the overall event lifecycle and oversee community content. The moderation and administration panels allow for handling user permissions, monitoring content for compliance with community guidelines, and addressing reported issues. Beyond primary interactions, there is also an integrated system of push notifications and email reminders that keeps users informed about new matches to their interests, upcoming events, or changes in ticket availability. The notifications settings page allows users to customize both the frequency and type of alerts they receive, such as opting for instant notifications or choosing daily or weekly summaries.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the settings section, users can update their personal information, change their password, and modify notification preferences. This area also includes account management features, such as language preferences and notification settings which can be adjusted easily. For those handling transactions, there are dedicated billing pages where users can manage their digital payment methods, view past transactions, and update payment details. Once adjustments are made in the settings or billing sections, users are seamlessly returned to the main dashboard, maintaining the continuity of their experience without interruption.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is built to handle a variety of error states gracefully. If a user enters incorrect or invalid information during registration or ticket purchase, clear error messages are displayed that explain the issue and guide the user toward a resolution. In the case of connectivity issues or failures in payment processing, fallback messages are shown along with suggestions such as trying again or choosing an alternative payment method like cash or Cliq. Similarly, when users attempt restricted actions, such as accessing administrative pages without proper permissions, they are redirected to a dedicated error page that explains the access limitation. These mechanisms ensure that users always understand the next steps required to regain normal operation within the app.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the initial landing page to daily interactions, the user journey within this platform is simple and connected. New users are smoothly onboarded with multiple sign-up options and language preferences, then quickly led to a personalized dashboard where event information is easily accessible. Attendees can explore events using detailed filters, interactive maps, and comprehensive event pages, while organizers have specialized tools to manage their events and track performance through basic analytics. The overall design reinforces a mobile-first approach and secure digital transaction practices with multiple local payment methods. Backed by solid error handling and clear user guidance, the app supports a cohesive experience from sign-up to regular engagement, ensuring that every interaction is intuitive and aligned with the projectâ€™s goals of boosting local event discovery and seamless ticketing.
