## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Initialize Project Repository**: Create a new Git repository and add two main directories: `/backend` for Django and `/frontend` for React-Native code. Create `main` and `dev` branches with branch protection rules as per the PRD (see PRD Section 1 and Constraints).
2.  **Set Up Django Environment**: In the `/backend` directory, create a Python virtual environment and install Django (using the recommended version from internal guidelines). Reference: Tech Stack Document (Django). Validate by running `django-admin --version`.
3.  **Set Up React-Native Environment**: In the `/frontend` directory, initialize a React-Native project configured for a mobile-first responsive web app. Use React Native CLI (as noted in the Tech Stack Document). Validate by running the default app on a simulator/emulator.
4.  **Install Additional Tools**: Ensure you have OAuth libraries, and any necessary payment gateway SDKs (for card payments, cash-at-event, and Cliq integration) as per Q&A (Payment Integration) and PRD Section 4. Validate installations with appropriate version commands.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Implement Authentication Screen**: Create `/frontend/src/components/AuthScreen.js` to handle user sign-up and login with OAuth, email, and phone-based authentication. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & User Registration & Authentication requirements).
2.  **Add Language Toggle Component**: Within the authentication page, add a toggle for Arabic and English language selection. Create `/frontend/src/components/LanguageToggle.js`. (Reference: PRD Section 4 on Bilingual Support).
3.  **Apply Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Utilize responsive styling (using React Native’s StyleSheet or a responsive design library) to ensure components adapt to mobile devices. Validate by testing on multiple screen sizes. (Reference: PRD Section 7: Mobile-First Responsive Design).
4.  **Develop Event Discovery Screen**: Create `/frontend/src/components/EventDiscovery.js` where users can search for events using keywords, categories, and geolocation. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & Core Feature: Event Discovery & Search).
5.  **Integrate Interactive Map View**: In the Event Discovery screen, embed an interactive map view (using a library such as react-native-maps or react-native-web-maps) that displays nearby events. (Reference: App Flow Document: Event Discovery and Browsing). Validate map responsiveness by simulating location changes.
6.  **Build Wishlist Feature**: Create `/frontend/src/components/Wishlist.js` to allow users to bookmark/save events for later. (Reference: PRD Section 3: Wishlist & Save for Later). Validate functionality with unit tests.
7.  **Implement Notification Settings**: Create `/frontend/src/components/NotificationSettings.js` for users to adjust push notification and email reminder preferences (instant, daily, weekly). (Reference: Q&A: Notification Frequency and Triggers). Validate by simulating changes in notification preferences.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  **Create Django Project**: In `/backend`, run `django-admin startproject event_platform` and configure the initial project settings. (Reference: PRD Section 1 and Tech Stack Document: Django).
2.  **Develop Events App**: Within the Django project, create an app called `events` (using `python manage.py startapp events`). (Reference: PRD Section 3: Event Creation & Management).
3.  **Build User Authentication APIs**: In `/backend/event_platform/events/views.py`, develop REST API endpoints for user registration and authentication using Django REST Framework. Implement OAuth, email, and phone sign-ups as per requirement. (Reference: PRD Section 3 and User Registration & Authentication details). Validate using Postman.
4.  **Develop Event CRUD APIs**: In the same app, implement API endpoints for event creation, editing, deletion, and retrieval (CRUD). (Reference: PRD Section 3: Event Creation and Management). Validate using Django unit tests.
5.  **Implement Ticketing System Endpoints**: Create a new Django app (e.g., `tickets`) with endpoints in `/backend/event_platform/tickets/views.py` to support both free and paid events. (Reference: PRD Section 4: Ticketing System). Validate using curl commands for test transactions.
6.  **Integrate Payment Gateway**: In `/backend/event_platform/config/payment_settings.py` (or similar configuration file), implement integration for digital payments supporting card payments via an API, cash payment option, and Cliq. Ensure compliance with PCI-DSS standards. (Reference: Q&A: Payment Gateway Providers and PRD Section 4). Validate by simulating a secure transaction.
7.  **Develop Event Discovery API**: Enhance event listing endpoints in `/backend/event_platform/events/views.py` to include geolocation filtering and map-based queries. (Reference: PRD Section 3: Event Discovery & Search). Validate with Django tests and sample geolocation queries.
8.  **Create Administrative & Moderation Endpoints**: Develop dedicated endpoints for platform administrators and moderators in an app (e.g., `admin_tools`) or within existing apps. These endpoints will manage system operations, user permissions, and content moderation. (Reference: PRD Section 4: Administrative and Moderation Tools). Validate via Django admin and API testing.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  **Link Frontend with Authentication API**: In `/frontend/src/services/api.js`, implement axios (or fetch) calls that connect the AuthScreen with the Django authentication endpoints. (Reference: App Flow Document: User Onboarding and Registration). Validate by testing sign-up and login flows end-to-end.
2.  **Connect Event CRUD APIs with Frontend**: Update the EventDiscovery and Wishlist components to fetch, create, and display events using the REST API endpoints developed in Django. (Reference: PRD Section 3: Event Management & Discovery). Validate by manually verifying event creation and listing.
3.  **Wire Up Payment Gateway**: Ensure the frontend ticket purchase flow invokes the ticketing API which, in turn, connects to the integrated payment gateway. (Reference: Q&A: Payment and PRD Section 4: Ticketing System). Validate with simulated payment transactions ensuring PCI-DSS compliance.
4.  **Configure CORS in Django**: Install and configure `django-cors-headers` in `/backend/event_platform/settings.py` to allow requests from your frontend domain. (Reference: Tech Stack Document for Django integration). Validate with cross-origin request tests.
5.  **Integrate Notification Workflows**: Link backend scheduled tasks (or asynchronous job queues) with frontend notification settings to trigger push notifications and email alerts based on user actions. (Reference: Q&A: Notification triggers and frequency). Validate by triggering test notifications.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Prepare Production Settings for Django**: Create `/backend/event_platform/settings_production.py` with production-level settings (security, allowed hosts, database configurations, etc.). (Reference: PRD Section 6: Compliance & Reliability).
2.  **Deploy Django Backend**: Deploy the Django application to your chosen cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku) using your production settings. Configure monitoring and logging. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: Deployment). Validate by accessing the production API endpoints.
3.  **Build and Deploy Frontend**: Bundle the React-Native web build and deploy static assets to an AWS S3 bucket (with CloudFront CDN in the `us-east-1` region). (Reference: PRD Section 6: Deployment and App Flow Document: Final UI Integration). Validate by accessing the public URL.
4.  **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline**: Create a CI/CD configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to automate tests and deployments for both backend and frontend. (Reference: Tech Stack Document: CI/CD Deployment). Validate by triggering a deployment pipeline run.
5.  **End-to-End Production Testing**: Run full e2e tests (using Cypress or similar) on the deployed URLs to ensure integration and performance meet project requirements. (Reference: Q&A: Pre-Launch Checklist).

## Phase 6: Post-Launch

1.  **Enable Monitoring and Error Tracking**: Integrate an error tracking tool (e.g., Sentry) with Django. Configure monitoring of API latency, errors, and system performance. Place configuration in `/backend/event_platform/sentry_config.py`. (Reference: Q&A: Performance and Monitoring).
2.  **Schedule Automated Backups**: Set up a cron job (using `pg_dump` or your chosen method) for daily backups of the database to an AWS S3 bucket. (Reference: PRD Section 7: Scalability and Compliance). Validate by checking bucket logs.
3.  **Conduct Performance & Load Testing**: Schedule regular performance tests using tools like Locust in a staging environment to simulate 1k concurrent users. (Reference: PRD Section 5: Scalability Concerns). Validate that error rates remain below targeted thresholds.
4.  **Plan for Future Scalability and Feature Updates**: Establish a process for gathering user feedback for potential native mobile app development and design refinements (logos, color schemes, branding) to be implemented in future phases. (Reference: Q&A: Mobile-first design and Brand Guidelines).

**Overall Validation**: After each phase, perform specific tests as outlined to ensure each component—from environment setups, API integrations, transaction flows, to UI responsiveness—is functioning as expected before moving to the next phase.
