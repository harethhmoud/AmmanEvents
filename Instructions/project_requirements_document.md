# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is about building a centralized platform for event discovery in Jordan. It aims to bring together event organizers, attendees, and local businesses on one streamlined platform. The core idea is to allow event organizers to create and manage their events with ease, while giving attendees a hassle-free way to find events near them using geolocation and interactive map views. The platform also supports digital ticketing for both free and paid events, ensuring secure payment processes through local payment gateways, such as card processing, cash-at-event, and Cliq.

The platform is being created to solve the fragmentation in the event space by providing a single, user-friendly solution that caters to todayâ€™s diverse audience. Key objectives include seamless event discovery, straightforward ticketing with secure payments (complying with PCI-DSS), and robust event management tools for organizers which include basic analytics and effective marketing. Success will be measured by high user engagement, increased ticket sales, and positive feedback from both organizers and attendees.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Event Creation & Management: Comprehensive tools for event organizers to create and manage events.
*   Dual Views: Separate vendor and customer views.
*   Ticketing System: Support for free and paid events with digital payments (including card payments via API, cash options at events, and Cliq).
*   User Registration & Authentication: Multiple sign-up methods including OAuth, email, and phone-based authentication.
*   Event Discovery & Search: Filters using keywords, categories, and geolocation features with interactive map views.
*   Wishlist & Save for Later: Users can bookmark events they are interested in.
*   Push Notifications and Email Reminders: Personalized alerts with selectable frequency options (instant, daily, weekly) triggered by user interests and event updates.
*   Bilingual Support: Arabic and English language support with manual translations for UI and static content and automated tools for user-generated content.
*   Basic Organizer Analytics: Key metrics such as ticket sales, engagement rates, demographics, CTR, and feedback scores.
*   Mobile-First Responsive Design: A responsive web app optimized for mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
*   Administrative & Moderation Tools: Backend modules for platform administrators and moderators to manage system operations, user permissions, and content moderation.
*   Third-Party Integrations: Social media sharing integrations (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) and email marketing tools (like Mailchimp).

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Native Mobile Applications: Direct native app development for iOS/Android is deferred to later phases.
*   Detailed Design and Branding Guidelines: Visual elements, logos, and detailed color schemes to be developed later.
*   Advanced Analytical Tools Beyond Basic Metrics: For now, only essential analytics for event performance will be developed.
*   Extended Third-Party Integrations: Beyond the basics (social media sharing and email marketing), additional integrations are planned for future iterations.
*   Comprehensive automated translation systems: While some automated translation for user-generated content will be implemented, critical UI components will rely on manual translation for cultural accuracy.

## 3. User Flow

A new user who visits the platform will first encounter a sign-up page where they can register using either OAuth, email, or phone authentication. Upon choosing their preferred language (Arabic or English), they complete the registration process quickly and are then directed to a personalized dashboard. This dashboard provides an overview of upcoming events, their wishlist, and options to update their profile. The layout is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience across all devices.

As users navigate through the platform, they can easily discover events by searching with keywords, filtering by categories, or using geolocation features which not only filter events by proximity but also visualize them on a map view. After selecting an event, users are presented with detailed information including event schedules, venue details, ticketing options, and organizer data. They can directly purchase tickets through secure payment integrations or choose to save the event for later. Additionally, push notifications and email alerts, personalized to user preferences, keep users informed about upcoming events and purchase status changes.

    *   Must comply with PCI-DSS standards for payment security.
    *   The current phase is a responsive web app; native mobile apps will be considered based on future feedback.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   The initial focus on core features for event discovery and ticketing will cover the majority of user needs.
    *   Dual language support is essential from the start, with manual curation for key UI elements.
    *   There is an expectation that user engagement with push notifications and reminders will drive better conversion rates.
    *   Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Cursor will be integrated smoothly into the development workflow.
    *   Future scalability requirements can be met by extending the existing tech stack when necessary.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits and Payment Integration Issues:**

    *   Payment gateway APIs might have rate limits or intermittent outages. Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms (e.g., cash payment options) to mitigate potential interruptions.

*   **Geolocation Accuracy & Map View Challenges:**

    *   Ensuring precise geolocation data and a responsive map view across different devices could be challenging. Use robust map API libraries and conduct thorough testing across various devices.

*   **Bilingual Content Management:**

    *   Maintaining up-to-date and culturally relevant translations can be complex. Establish clear processes for manual translation of static content and use automated translation with moderation for dynamic content.

*   **Notification System Overload:**

    *   Over-notification could lead to user fatigue. Ensure settings are highly customizable, allowing users to control the frequency and relevance of alerts.

*   **Scalability Concerns:**

    *   As the platform grows with more users and events, performance issues could surface. Design the backend with scalability in mind and consider future migrations or optimizations.

*   **Administrative Overhead:**

    *   Balancing ease of use for administrators while keeping a secure and well-moderated system might pose challenges. Early planning for admin tools and clear content moderation guidelines will be essential.
